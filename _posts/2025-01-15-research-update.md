Here is a quick snapshot of what I've been working on recently:

### 1) New dataset experiments
Early results show improved robustness with simple augmentations. I plan to release code and benchmarks soon.

### 2) Upcoming talk
I'll be giving a talk on self-supervised learning next monthâ€”slides will be shared after the event.
